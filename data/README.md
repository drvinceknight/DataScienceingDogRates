## Twitter secrets

To be able to use the twitter api this assumes you have a `secrets.py` file
with the various tokens/keys in it. It should look like this:

```python
"""
Twitter consumer key information, available from https://apps.twitter.com
"""
consumer_key = "..."
consumer_secret = "..."
access_token = "..."
access_token_secret = "..."
```
